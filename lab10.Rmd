## beepr beeps

Use the function 'beep()' in the beepr package to make an audio alert when your code is done running.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
for(i in rev(seq(1:999))) {
  print(paste(i, "bottles of beer on the wall"))
}
beep()
```

## praise and cowsay

Packages built with a single purpose: to be kind and fun.

```{r}
praise("${Exclamation}, ${EXCLAMATION}...${exclamation}!!!")

praise("Holy ${creating}, Batman - this code is ${ADJECTIVE}!")
```

Use cowsay::say() to make a character say something to you.
